        "### 1. Abstract\n",
        "\n",
        "This project investigates whether countries with higher **economic freedom** tend to be **happier** in **2019**, using the *World Happiness Report 2019* and the *Index of Economic Freedom* datasets. The workflow combines (i) data cleaning + merging into a unified country-level dataset, (ii) exploratory analysis to visualize the relationship between freedom and happiness, (iii) hypothesis testing using a median-based High vs Low freedom split, and (iv) machine learning models to assess predictive power and identify which freedom dimensions matter most.\n",

        "### 2. Introduction & Research Question\n",
        "\n",
        "Happiness is often discussed alongside economic development, but GDP alone does not fully explain differences in well-being. This study focuses on “structural” aspects of economic freedom—such as **property rights**, **government integrity**, and **business freedom**—and tests whether these freedom indicators are associated with better (lower) happiness rank and/or higher happiness score.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core research question:**\n",
        "Do countries with higher economic freedom have higher happiness in 2019 (measured by better rank / higher score)?\n",

        "Phase 2 implements the full data engineering pipeline:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Programmatic download** using `kagglehub`.\n",
        "2. **Robust CSV loading** to handle encoding issues (UTF-8 vs Latin-1).\n",
        "3. **Country name standardization** (e.g., “Turkiye → Turkey”, “Korea, South → South Korea”) to ensure consistent join keys.\n",
        "4. **Filter economic freedom dataset to Year = 2019**.\n",
        "5. **Inner join on `Country`**, producing a final merged dataset of approximately **145 countries** that exist in both sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output artifact:** A clean merged dataset intended to be saved and reused for downstream analysis (Phase 3 expects `final_dataset_2019.csv` produced in Phase 2).\n",

        "\n",
        "EDA is used to examine the raw relationship between economic freedom and happiness and to sanity-check distributions and outliers.\n",

        "* `Index_Score` vs `Happiness_Score` (main continuous relationship)\n",

        "#### 6.1 Grouping Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "Countries are split into **High Freedom** and **Low Freedom** groups using the **median** of the economic freedom score:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Index_Score ≥ median` → High Freedom\n",
        "* `Index_Score < median` → Low Freedom\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6.2 Statistical Tests\n",
        "\n",
        "The main test described and used is the **Welch Two-Sample t-test**, chosen because it does not assume equal variances between groups.\n",
        "(README also proposes a Mann–Whitney U nonparametric robustness test; include it if your course expects an ordinal-focused nonparametric comparison.)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6.3 Key Finding\n",
        "\n",
        "Using `Happiness_Rank` as the outcome, the project reports a large and statistically significant difference:\n",
        "\n",
        "* High Freedom mean rank ≈ **47** (better/happier)\n",
        "* Low Freedom mean rank ≈ **104** (worse/less happy)\n",
        "* p-value reported as extremely small, rejecting the null hypothesis at conventional levels\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion from inference:** In 2019, countries with higher economic freedom tend to be significantly happier by rank-based measures.\n",

        "### 7. Phase 3 — Machine Learning (Predictive + Interpretability)\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase 3 extends beyond significance testing and asks: *How well can freedom metrics predict happiness, and which freedom dimensions are most informative?*\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7.1 Data Input & Consistency with Phase 2\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase 3 explicitly loads the merged dataset “exactly like Phase 2,” either by reusing `merged_df` in memory or loading `final_dataset_2019.csv`.\n",
        "It validates that required columns exist before modeling (at minimum `Happiness_Rank` and `Index Score`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7.2 Features and Target\n",
        "\n",
        "**Target (implemented in Phase 3):** `Happiness_Rank` (regression target).\n",
        "**Features:** Primarily economic freedom metrics (overall index plus sub-scores when present), with a fallback to “all numeric columns except target” if expected subscores are missing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7.3 Validation Strategy & Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the dataset is small (~145 rows), Phase 3 uses:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Train/test split** (20% test) and **5-fold cross-validation**\n",
        "* Regression metrics: **MAE, RMSE, R²**\n",
        "* Classification metrics (optional track): **Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7.4 Models Trained (Implemented)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Regression models:** LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor.\n",
        "Linear models include scaling; tree/boosting models omit scaling (pipelines are built accordingly).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Classification (optional):** High vs Low happiness classification based on whether a country’s rank is <= the median rank (note: lower rank means happier).\n",
        "Models: LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7.5 Model Selection, Outputs, and Reproducibility\n",
        "\n",
        "* Best regression model is chosen by lowest cross-validated RMSE, then evaluated on the held-out test set; results are saved to CSV and the best model is saved as a `.joblib` artifact.\n",
        "* Phase 3 computes **permutation feature importance** (30 repeats) for interpretability and saves it to `ml_feature_importance.csv`.\n",
        "* Classification results are also cross-validated and the best classifier is saved similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note: The Phase 3 file defines the evaluation framework and saving behavior, but the actual numeric results (e.g., CV_RMSE, Test R², Test AUC) depend on running the pipeline on the produced dataset.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. Discussion\n",
        "\n",
        "The project’s statistical testing indicates a clear difference in happiness rank between high- and low-freedom groups in 2019.  Phase 3 complements this by measuring predictive strength and producing a ranked list of the most predictive freedom dimensions via permutation importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation guidance (important for the final write-up):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* These results demonstrate *association*, not causality. Cross-country happiness is influenced by many confounders (income, institutions, health, conflict, inequality, etc.), some of which are partially correlated with freedom indicators.\n",
        "* Using rank as the primary target is defensible (robust, interpretable), but score is continuous and may improve regression behavior; the README frames score as “preferred,” while Phase 3 currently targets rank.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Single-year scope (2019):** Limits generalizability across time; relationships may change year-to-year.\n",
        "2. **Country coverage:** Inner join keeps only overlapping countries (~145), which may bias toward countries with complete reporting.\n",
        "3. **Potential confounding:** Economic freedom correlates with development and institutional quality; controlling variables would be required for causal claims.\n",
        "4. **Metric mismatch:** README emphasizes `Happiness_Score` as primary continuous target, but Phase 3 implementation currently predicts `Happiness_Rank`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Using 2019 data, this project finds that countries with **higher economic freedom** are **significantly happier** when happiness is measured by global happiness rank.  The ML extension provides a practical predictive framework with cross-validation, model comparison, and interpretability via permutation feature importance, enabling the project to move from “is there a difference?” to “which freedom factors matter most and how predictable is happiness from them?”\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want, I can also format this into a **proper PDF/Word-style report layout** (title page, figures list, references section) in the exact template your course wants—just tell me the required format (APA/IEEE/none).\n"
