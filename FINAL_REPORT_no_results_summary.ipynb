    "- **EDA** (scatter plots and distributions)\n",
    "- **Hypothesis testing** using a *median split* (High vs Low Freedom)\n",
    "- **Machine learning** (regression + optional classification) to assess predictive power and feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key finding (rank-based):** Countries in the **High Freedom** group have substantially better (lower) average happiness rank than countries in the **Low Freedom** group (≈ 47 vs ≈ 104), indicating a statistically meaningful difference.\n",
